LCD LCM1602 IIC V1

I was trying to get my LCD screen work with Arduino Uno|Ethernet, and had to test a lot of libraries.
Finally i found the one wich works fine with my screen. And i figured out the inicialization strings to get it work.
Just saving here for myself simple example.

LCD LCM1602 IIC V1 is like SainSmart IIC/I2C/TWI 1602.
